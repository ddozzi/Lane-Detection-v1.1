How it works? (Still need to upload car detection video) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMY9bS52ZXY


Free to use just don't claim it as your own.


If you want to use it click the download code button. and go to terminal and type 
```pip install moviepy, glob, pickle, numpy, opencv-python ``` 
once installed put your input video and put it in the same folder as the code, and rename the video to: project_video.
and run the script it should only take a couple minutes. ok bye
